##  üéØ Announcement

Besides the wonderful papers we list above, we are very happy to announce that our group, THU-AEAI (Autonomous Embodied AI) Laboratory, recently released a preprint titled: [EvoAgent: Agent Autonomous Evolution with Continual World Model for Long-Horizon Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05907), the first autonomous-evolution agent with a continual World Model, which can autonomously complete various long-horizon tasks across environments through self-planning, self-control, and self-reflection, without human intervention. If this paper inspires you, you may consider cite it via:
